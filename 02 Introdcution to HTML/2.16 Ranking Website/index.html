<h1>Game Rankings: of Games I'm Currently Playing</h1>
<h2>These are my preferences on what to play in no particular order</h2>

<h3>CS:GO</h3>
<p>Just a nice shooter to play in my freetime. It's competitive and sweaty, but I don't have any others I usually feel like playing.</p>

<h3>League of Legends</h3>
<p>Another competitive game I play. I enjoy the fact that unlike CSGO, it's not purely pvp based. The minor PvE elements of the game keep me having fun and interested even when
    my team is inting. Also the fact that each match feels like 4 games in 1 (where each lane/role is a different game: mid, top, bot/sup, jungle) means I can still win my individual
    game even if my team loses the match overall.

<h3>Final Fantasy XIV</h3>
<p>What can I say, MMOs are fun and I love the story and raids that this one provides.</p>
